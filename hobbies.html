<h2> Hobbies </h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Running</strong></dt>
<dd> I have been running for a while now and it is something I really enjoy doing. It can be hard at times but the
feeling finishing a hard run really makes me happy. I have not been able to run like I used to for about a year because I became injured
I needed surgery so I can run again. I am hoping to be able to run soon and get back to the level of running I was doing a year ago.</dd>
<dt><strong>Field Hockey</strong></dt>
<dd> I have been playing field hockey since second grade. My mom played when she was in high school and she wanted me to try it out.
I feel in love with the sport and continued to play all through out school. It is one of my favoirte things to do. I started playing as a forward
because when you play at a young level everyone loves to score goals but as time went on a fell in love with playing as defence. I moved to a defence position
at the end of middle school and stayed there for all four years in high school. My greatest accomplishments as a field hockey player would be becoming a captian my
my senior year of high school and making saves when they goalie couldn't get to the ball in time. </dd>
<dt><strong>Hiking</strong></dt>
<dd>I love to hike. I love being outdoors in nature and appreciating its beauty! It is a fun activity that I love to do with friends on days when they
weather is nice. Due to being injured for around a year I have not been able to hike as much as I want to but I remember some hikes that I can't wait to do again.</dd>
<dt><strong>Traveling</strong></dt>
<dd>I love to travel and learn about new places. I have been to Canada, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaca, Mexico, and a
couple little island around the caribian.
